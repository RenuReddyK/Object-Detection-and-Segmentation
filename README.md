# Object-Detection-and-Segmentation
Implemeted the following from sracth by following the research papers:

## YOLO:
Implemented from scratch based on the original research paper, YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that efficiently processes images in a single pass, providing high accuracy and speed.

## SOLO:
Developed from the ground up using research paper insights, SOLO (Segmentation of Objects by Learning Only) is a sophisticated instance segmentation model that excels in precisely delineating individual object instances within an image.
