# Object-Detection-and-Segmentation

**YOLO**
Implemented from scratch based on the original research paper, YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that efficiently processes images in a single pass, providing high accuracy and speed.

**SOLO**
Developed from the ground up using research paper insights, SOLO (Segmentation of Objects by Learning Only) is a sophisticated instance segmentation model that excels in precisely delineating individual object instances within an image.

**SegFormer**
Constructed from the research paper, SegFormer is a cutting-edge semantic segmentation model that adopts a transformer-based architecture, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in pixel-level image segmentation tasks.

**VAE**
Implemented a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on the Fashion MNIST dataset involving training a neural network architecture to learn a probabilistic mapping of input images to a latent space. 

**CycleGAN**
Constructed from scratch following the research paper, CycleGAN on STL-10 dataset. It is a powerful unsupervised learning model that facilitates domain adaptation by mapping images from one domain to another without paired training data, showcasing impressive results in image-to-image translation tasks.
